                position of the spin. 
                
                Default is **None**. Overrides ``Simulator.magnetic_field`` if provided.

            pulses (list or int or Sequence): Number of pulses in CPMG sequence.

                **OR**

                Sequence of the instantaneous ideal control pulses.
                It can be provided as an instance of ``Sequence`` class or a list with ``Pulse`` objects.
                (See documentation for pycce.Sequence).
                
                ``pulses`` can be provided as a list with tuples or dictionaries,
                each tuple or dictionary is used to initialize ``Pulse`` class instance.

                For example, for only central spin pulses the ``pulses`` argument
                can be provided as a list of tuples, containing:

                1. axis the rotation is about;
                2. angle of rotation;
                3. (optional) Time before the pulse. Can be as fixed, as well as varied.
                   If varied, it should be provided as an array with the same
                   length as ``timespace``.

                E.g. for Hahn-Echo the ``pulses`` can be defined as ``[('x', np.pi)]`` or 
                ``[('x', np.pi, timespace / 2)]``.

                    If only **some** delays are provided, assumes ``delay = 0``  in the pulses without delay.

                    Then total experiment is assumed to be:

                        tau -- pulse -- 2tau -- pulse -- ... -- 2tau -- pulse -- tau

                    Where tau is the delay between pulses.

                    The sum of delays at each time point should be less or equal to the total time of the experiment
                    at the same time point, provided in ``timespace`` argument.

                By default is equal to :math:`R\ket{0}` state of the ``.center``
                where :math:`R` is a product of all rotations applied in the pulse sequence.
                Can be set as a vector in :math:`S_z` basis, the index of the central spin Hamiltonian
                eigenstate, or as a callable with call signature ``i(dm)``, where ``dm`` is a density matrix of the 
                central spin. If callable, ``j`` parameter is ignored.

            j (int or ndarray with shape (2s+1, ) or callable): Used in gCCE calculations.
                Along with ``i`` parameter indicates which density matrix element to compute.
                
                By default is equal to :math:`R\ket{1}` state of the ``.center``
                where :math:`R` is a product of all rotations applied in the pulse sequence.
                Can be set as a vector in :math:`S_z` basis, the index of the central spin Hamiltonian
                eigenstate, or as a callable with call signature ``j(dm)``, where ``dm`` is a density matrix of the 
                central spin. If callable, ``i`` parameter is ignored.
    
            as_delay (bool): True if time points are delay between pulses (for equispaced pulses),
                False if time points are total time. Ignored in gCCE if ``pulses`` contains the time fractions.
                Conventional CCE calculations do not support custom time fractions.

                Default is **False**.

                sample over states of the supercluster.

                Default is **False**.

            state (ndarray with shape (2s+1,)):
                Initial state of the central spin, used in gCCE and noise autocorrelation calculations.
                
                Defaults to :math:`\frac{1}{N}(\ket{0} + \ket{1})` if not set.
    
            bath_state (array-like):
                List of bath spin states. If ``len(shape) == 1``, contains
                :math:`I_z` projections of :math:`I_z` eigenstates.
                Otherwise, contains array of initial density matrices of bath spins.
    
                Default is **None**. If not set, the code assumes completely random spin bath
                (density matrix of each nuclear spin is proportional to identity, :math:`\hat {\mathbb{1}}/N`).

            nbstates (int): Number or random bath states to sample over.

                If provided, sampling of random states is carried and ``bath_states`` values are
                ignored.
                    
                Default is 0.

            seed (int): Seed for random number generator, used in random bath states sampling.
                
                Default is **None**.

            masked (bool):
                True if mask numerically unstable points (with coherence > 1)
                in the averaging over bath states. 
                
                .. note::
                
                    It is up to user to check whether the possible instability is due to numerical error
                    or unphysical assumptions of the calculations.

                Default is **True** for coherence calculations, **False** for noise calculations.

            parallel_states (bool):
                True if to use MPI to parallelize the calculations of density matrix equally over
                present mpi processes for random bath state sampling calculations.
                
                Compared to ``parallel`` keyword,
                when this argument is True each process is given a fraction of random bath states.
                This makes the implementation faster. Works best when the
                number of bath states is divisible by the number of processes, ``nbstates % size == 0``.
    
                Default is **False**.

            second_order (bool):
                True if add second order perturbation theory correction
                to the cluster Hamiltonian in conventional CCE.
                Relevant only for conventional CCE calculations.
                
                If set to True sets the qubit states as eigenstates of central spin Hamiltonian
                from the following procedure. If qubit states are provided as vectors in :math:`S_z` basis,
                for each qubit state compute the fidelity of the qubit state and
                all eigenstates of the central spin and chose the one with fidelity higher than ``level_confidence``.
                If such state is not found, raises an error.
    
                .. warning::
    
                    Second order corrections are not implemented as mean field.
                    
                    I.e., setting ``second_order=True``
                    and ``nbstates != 0`` leads to the calculation, when mean field effect is accounted only from
                    dipolar interactions within the bath.
    
                Default is **False**.
    
            level_confidence (float): Maximum fidelity of the qubit state to be considered eigenstate of the
                central spin Hamiltonian. 
                
                Default is 0.95.
    
            direct (bool):
                True if use direct approach (requires way more memory but might be more numerically stable).
                False if use memory efficient approach.
                
                Default is **False**.
    
            parallel (bool):
                True if parallelize calculation of cluster contributions over different mpi processes.

                Default is **False**."""


# TODO unit conversion
class Simulator:
    r"""
    The main class for CCE calculations.

    The typical usage includes:

        1. Read array of the bath spins. This is done with ``Simulator.read_bath`` method which accepts either
           reading from .xyz file or from the ``BathArray`` instance with defined positions and names of the bath spins.
           In the process, the subset of the array within the distance of ``r_dipole`` from the central spin is taken
           and for this subset the Hyperfine couplings can be generated.

           If no ``hyperfine`` keyword is provided and there are some hyperfine couplings already,
           then no changes are done to the hyperfine tensors.
           If ``hyperfine='pd'``, the hyperfine couplings are computed assuming point dipole approximation. For all
           accepted arguments, see ``Simulator.read_bath``.

        2. Generate set of clusters with ``Simulator.generate_clusters``,
           determined by the maximum connectivity radius ``r_dipole``
           and the maximum size of the cluster ``order``.

        3. Compute the desired property with ``Simulator.compute`` method.

    .. note::

        Directly setting up the attribute values will rerun ``Simulator.read_bath``
        and/or ``Simulator.generate_clusters`` to reflect updated value of the given attribute.

        E.g. If ``Simulator.r_bath`` is set to some new value after initialization,
        then ``Simulator.read_bath`` and ``Simulator.generate_clusters`` are called with the increased bath.

    First two steps are usually done during the initialization of the ``Simulator`` object by providing the necessary
    arguments.

    Notes:

        Depending on the number of provided arguments, in the initialization process will call the following methods
        to setup the calculation engine.

        - If ``bath`` is provided, ``Simulator.read_bath`` is called with additional keywords in ``**bath_kw``.
        - If both ``r_dipole`` and ``order`` are provided and ``bath`` is not None,
          the ``Simulator.generate_clusters`` is called.

        See the corresponding method documentation for details.

    Examples::

        >>> atoms = random_bath('13C', 100, number=2000, seed=10)
        >>> calc = Simulator(1, bath=atoms, r_bath=40, r_dipole=6,
        >>>                  order=2, D=2.88 * 1e6,
        >>>                  magnetic_field=500, pulses=1)
        >>> print(calc)

            two spins, and the summation of :math:`i, j` goes only over the edges of the minimally connected cluster.

            We define minimally connected cluster as a cluster with lowest possible number of edges that still forms
            a connected graph. If multiple choices of the minimally connected cluster
            for the same cluster are possible, the one with the larger strength :math:`s` is chosen.

        The dynamics are simulated using the Hamiltonian:

            &\hat H_S = \mathbf{SDS} + \mathbf{B\gamma}_{S}\mathbf{S} \\
            &\hat H_{SB} = \sum_i \mathbf{S}\mathbf{A}_i\mathbf{I}_i \\

                           \sum_{i>j} \mathbf{I}_i\mathbf{J}_{ij}\mathbf{I}_j

        Here :math:`\hat H_S` is the central spin Hamiltonian with Zero Field splitting tensor :math:`\mathbf{D}` and
        gyromagnetic ratio tensor :math:`\mathbf{\gamma_S} = \mu_S \mathbf{g}`
        are read from ``Simulator.zfs`` and ``Simulator.gyro`` respectively.

        The :math:`\hat H_{SB}` is the Hamiltonian describing interactions between central spin and the bath.
        The hyperfine coupling tensors :math:`\mathbf{A}_i` are read from the ``BathArray`` stored in
        ``Simulator.bath['A']``. They can be generated using point dipole approximation or provided
        by the user (see ``Simulator.read_bath`` for details).

        The :math:`\hat H_{B}` is the Hamiltonian describing interactions between the bath spins.
        The self interaction tensors :math:`\mathbf{P}_i` are read from the ``BathArray`` stored in
        ``Simulator.bath['Q']`` and have to be provided by the user.

        The gyromagnetic ratios :math:`\mathbf{\gamma}_i` are read from the ``BathArray.gyros`` attribuite,
        which is generated from the properties of the types of bath spins, stored in ``BathArray.types``. They can
        either be provided by user or read from the ``pycce.common_isotopes`` object.

        The interaction tensors :math:`\mathbf{J}_{ij}` are assumed from point dipole approximation
        or can be provided  in ``BathArray.imap`` attrubite.

        .. note ::

            The ``compute`` method takes two keyword arguments to determine which quantity to compute and how:

                * `method` can take 'cce' or 'gcce' values, and determines
                  which method to use - conventional or generalized CCE.
                * `quantity` can take 'coherence' or 'noise' values, and determines
                  which quantity to compute - coherence function
                  or autocorrelation function of the noise.

            Each of the methods can be performed with monte carlo bath state sampling
            (if ``nbstates`` keyword is non zero)
            and with interlaced averaging (If ``interlaced`` keyword is set to ``True``).

        Examples:

            First set up Simulator object using random bath of 1000 13C nuclear spins.

                >>> import pycce as pc
                >>> import numpy as np
                >>> atoms = pc.random_bath('13C', 100, number=2000, seed=10) # Random spin bath
                >>> calc = pc.Simulator(1, bath=atoms, r_bath=40, r_dipole=6,
                >>>                     order=2, D=2.88 * 1e6, # D of NV in GHz -> kHz
                >>>                     magnetic_field=500, pulses=1)
                >>> ts = np.linspace(0, 2, 101) # timesteps

            We set magnetic field to 500 G along z-axis and chose 1 decoupling pulse (Hahn-echo) in this example.
            The zero field splitting is set to the one of NV center in diamond.

            Run conventional CCE calculation at time points ``timespace`` to obtain coherence without second order
            effects:

                >>> calc.compute(ts)

            This will call ``Simulator.cce_coherence`` method with default keyword values.

            Compute the coherence conventional CCE coherence with second order interactions between bath spins:

                >>> calc.compute(ts, second_order=True)

            Compute the coherence with conventional CCE with bath state sampling (over 10 states):

                >>> calc.compute(ts, nbstates=10)

            Compute the coherence with generalized CCE:

                >>> calc.compute(ts, method='gcce')

            This will call ``Simulator.gcce_dm`` method with default keyword values and obtain off diagonal
            element as :math:`\bra{0} \hat \rho_{C} \ket{1}`,
            where :math:`\hat \rho_{C}` is the density matrix of the qubit.

            Compute the coherence with generalized CCE with bath state sampling (over 10 states):

                >>> calc.compute(ts, method='gcce', nbstates=10)
