# pyCCE
Python code for computing qubit dynamics in the central spin model with CCE method

### Installation
Run 
`python setup.py install`
in the main folder.

### Base Units
Gyromagnetic ratios are given in rad * kHz / G.
Magnetic field in G.
Timesteps in ms. 
Distances in A.
All coupling constants are given in kHz.


### Usage
Usage consists of two steps: preparation of spin bath `BathArray` from `BathCell` and calculations with `Simulator` class.

See `examples` folder for tutorials and scripts of calculations.

### Documentation
Full documentation is available online at [ReadtheDocs](http://example.com "Title"). 



**TODO** Write more comprehensive README
