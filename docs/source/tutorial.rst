   tutorials/sic_vv
   tutorials/si_shallow
   tutorials/classical_noise
   tutorials/second_spin


The recommended order of the tutorials is from the top to bottom:

* :doc:`tutorials/diamond_nv` example goes through the :doc:`quickstart` example in more details.
* :doc:`tutorials/sic_vv` tutorial explores the difference between
  generalized CCE with and without random bath state sampling.
  Also, in this example we introduce the way to work with DFT output of hyperfine tensors.
* :doc:`tutorials/si_shallow` example shows the way to include the custom hyperfine couplings for more
  delocalized defects in semiconductors.
* :doc:`tutorials/classical_noise` example explains the way to use autocorrelation function of the noise
  to predict the decay of the coherence of the NV center in diamond.
* :doc:`tutorials/second_spin` example goes over the systems with two central spins, either forming a hybrid qubit,
  or system of two entangled qubits.
