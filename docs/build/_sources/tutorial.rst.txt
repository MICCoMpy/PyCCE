   tutorials/classical_noise


The recommended order of the tutorials is from the top to bottom:

* :doc:`tutorials/diamond_nv` example goes through the example above in more details.
* :doc:`tutorials/sic_vv` tutorial explores the difference between
  generalized CCE with and without random bath state sampling.
  Also, in this example we introduce the way to work with DFT output of hyperfine tensors.
* :doc:`tutorials/si_shallow` example shows the way to include the custom hyperfine couplings for more
  delocalized defects in semiconductors.
* :doc:`tutorials/classical_noise` example explains the way to use autocorrelation function of the noise
  to predict the decay of the coherence of the NV center in diamond.

The examples are also available as Jupyter notebooks in the Github repository.
